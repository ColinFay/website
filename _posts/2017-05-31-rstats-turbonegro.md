## tuRbonegro

Spoiler: the tuRbonegro package was created for fun only ;)

This package contains only one function, which launch and plays a random Turbonegro clip in your R Viewer. Because you know, some time you need some deathpunk. 

This function has three parameters:

+ `width`: width of the video, in pixel. Default is 560.
+ `height`: width of the video, in pixel. Default is 315.
+ `autoplay`: set video autoplay. Default is TRUE.

## Install 

To install on your machine : 

```r
devtools::install_github("ColinFay/tuRbonegro")
```

## Play a random clip 

```r

library(tuRbonegro)
tuRbonegro()
```
