Back from Budapest!

<!--more-->

This week, I had the chance to travel to Budapest to talk about R (obviously), dataviz, networks and text mining at the BudapestBI conference, and during the Budapest Users of R Network meetup. 

If you weren't there, or if you were but want to check my slides again, you can get them below.
